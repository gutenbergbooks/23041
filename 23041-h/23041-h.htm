PREFACE.</a></h4>


<p>The main rules which we proposed to ourselves in undertaking this
Edition are as follows:</p>

<p>1. To base the text on a thorough collation of the four Folios and of
all the Quarto editions of the separate plays, and of subsequent
editions and commentaries.</p>

<p>2. To give all the results of this collation in notes at the foot of
the page, and to add to these conjectural emendations collected and
suggested by ourselves, or furnished to us by our correspondents, so as
to give the reader in a compact form a complete view of the existing
materials out of which the text has been constructed, or may be
emended.</p>

<p>3. In all plays of which there is a Quarto edition differing from the
received text to such a degree that the variations cannot be shown in
foot-notes, to print the text of the Quarto <i>literatim</i> in a
smaller type after the received text.</p>

<p>4. To number the lines in each scene separately, so as to facilitate
reference.</p>

<p>5. To add at the end of each play a few notes, (<i>a</i>)&nbsp;to
explain such variations in the text of former editions as could not be
intelligibly expressed in the limits of a foot-note,
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
<a name = "page_x" id = "page_x"> </a>
(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;to justify any deviation from our ordinary rule either
in the text or the foot-notes, and (<i>c</i>)&nbsp;to illustrate some
passage of unusual difficulty or interest.</p>

<p>6. To print the Poems, edited on a similar plan, at the end of the
Dramatic Works.</p>

<p>An edition of Shakespeare on this plan has been for several years in
contemplation, and has been the subject of much discussion. That such an
edition was wanted seemed to be generally allowed, and it was thought
that Cambridge afforded facilities for the execution of the task such as
few other places could boast of. The Shakespearian collection given by
Capell to the Library of Trinity College supplied a mass of material
almost unrivalled in amount and value, and in some points unique; and
there, too, might be found opportunities for combined literary labour,
without which the work could not be executed at all. At least, if
undertaken by one person only, many years of unremitting diligence would
be required for its completion.</p>

<p>The first step towards the realization of the project was taken in
the spring of 1860, when the first act of <i>Richard the Second</i> was
printed by way of specimen, with a preface signed ‘W.&nbsp;G. Clark’ and
‘H.&nbsp;R. Luard,’<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href =
"#note1">1</a> where the principles, on which the proposed Edition
should be based, were set forth with the view ‘of obtaining opinions as
to the feasibility of the plan, and suggestions as to its
improvement.’</p>

<p>All the persons who answered this appeal expressed their warm
approval of the general plan, and many favoured us with suggestions as
to details, which we have either adopted, or at least not rejected
without careful and respectful consideration.</p>

<p>Since our work was commenced, we have learned that
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "page_xi" id = "page_xi"> </a>
the need of such an Edition has presented itself, independently, to the
minds of many literary men, and that a similar undertaking was
recommended as long ago as 1852, by Mr Bolton Corney, in <i>Notes and
Queries</i>, Vol. <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>
pp.&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3; and again by a correspondent of the same journal who
signs himself ‘Este,’ Vol. <span class = "smallroman">VIII.</span>
p.&nbsp;362.</p>

<p>This concurrence of opinion leads us to hope that our Edition will be
found to supply a real want, while, at the same time, the novelty of its
plan will exempt us from all suspicion of a design to supersede, or even
compete with, the many able and learned Editors who have preceded us in
the same field.</p>

<p>We will first proceed to explain the principles upon which we have
prepared our text.</p>


<h5>A. <i>With respect to the Readings.</i></h5>

<p>The basis of all texts of Shakespeare must be that of the earliest
Edition of the collected plays, the Folio of 1623, which, for more easy
reference, we have designated F<sub>1</sub><a class = "tag" name =
"tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a>. This we have mainly adopted,
unless there exists an earlier edition in quarto, as is the case in more
than one half of the thirty-six plays. When the first Folio is corrupt,
we have allowed some authority to the emendations of F<sub>2</sub> above
subsequent conjecture, and secondarily to F<sub>3</sub> and
F<sub>4</sub>; but a reference to our notes will show that the authority
even of F<sub>2</sub> in correcting is very small. Where we have Quartos
of authority, their variations from F<sub>1</sub> have been generally
accepted, except where they are manifest errors, and where the text of
the entire passage seems to be of an inferior recension to that of the
Folio. To show that the later Folios only corrected the first by
conjecture, we may instance two lines in <i>Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i>:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Give me your neif, Mounsieur Mustard Seed. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>&nbsp;1.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
‘Neif,’ which is spelt ‘niefe’ in Qq F<sub>1</sub>, becomes ‘newfe’ in
F<sub>2</sub>, ‘newse’ and ‘news’ in F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "page_xii" id = "page_xii"> </a>

<p class = "poem">
And finds his trusty Thisby’s mantle slain. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">V.</span>&nbsp;1.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
F<sub>1</sub> omits ‘trusty.’ F<sub>2</sub> makes up the line by
inserting ‘gentle.’</p>

<p>Where the Folios are all obviously wrong, and the Quartos also fail
us, we have introduced into the text several conjectural emendations;
especially we have often had recourse to Theobald’s ingenuity. But it
must be confessed that a study of errors detracts very much from the
apparent certainty of conjectures, the causelessness of the blunders
warning us off the hope of restoring, by general principles or by
discovery of causes of error.</p>

<p>For example: in the <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;1,</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Or else it stood upon the choice of merit,</p>

<p class = "nospace">
the reading of the Folios, is certainly wrong; but if we compare the
true reading preserved in the Quartos, ‘the choice of friends,’ we can
perceive no way to account for the change of ‘friends’ to ‘merit,’ by
which we might have retraced the error from ‘merit’ to ‘friends.’
Nothing like the ‘ductus literarum,’ or attraction of the eye to a
neighbouring word, can be alleged here.</p>

<p>Hence though we have admitted conjectures sometimes, we have not done
so as often as perhaps will be expected. For, in the first place, we
admit none because we think it better rhythm or grammar or sense, unless
we feel sure that the reading of the Folio is altogether impossible. In
the second place, the conjecture must appear to us to be the only
probable one. If the defect can be made good in more ways than one
equally plausible, or, at least, equally possible, we have registered
but not adopted these improvements, and the reader is intended to make
his own selection out of the notes.</p>

<p>For example, in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span>&nbsp;3. 80, we have assumed Mr Dyce’s
conjecture, ‘Cried I aim?’ to be the only satisfactory reading of a
passage decidedly wrong; but in the same play, <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;63, ‘Woman, art thou
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "page_xiii" id = "page_xiii"> </a>
lunaties?’ as the error may equally possibly be evaded by reading
‘lunacies’ with Rowe, and ‘lunatics’ with Capell, we have retained the
error.</p>

<p>The well-known canon of criticism, that of two readings ‘ceteris
paribus’ the more difficult is to be preferred, is not always to be
applied in comparing the readings of the Folios. For very frequently an
anomaly which would have been plausible on account of its apparent
archaism proves to be more archaic than Shakespeare, if the earlier
Quartos give the language of Shakespeare with more correctness. Ex.
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>&nbsp;2: ‘Scorn and derision never come in
tears’ Qq; ‘comes’ Ff; and in the same play, <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>&nbsp;1: ‘O how mine eyes do loath’
Q<sub>1</sub>, altered to ‘doth loath’ in Q<sub>2</sub> F<sub>1</sub>,
and restored, evidently by a grammatical reviser, to ‘do loath’ in
F<sub>2</sub> F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>. Again, <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;1: ‘what all but he do know,’ Qq, is altered
to ‘doth know’ in&nbsp;Ff.</p>

<p>This last error points to a very common anomaly in grammar; one which
seems almost to have become a rule, or, at any rate, a&nbsp;license in
Shakespeare’s own time, that a verb shall agree in number with the
nominative intervening between the true governing noun and the verb.</p>


<h5>B. <i>Grammar.</i></h5>

<p>In general, we do not alter any passage merely because the grammar is
faulty, unless we are convinced that the fault of grammar was due to the
printer altogether, and not to Shakespeare. We look upon it as no part
of our task to improve the poet’s grammar or correct his oversights:
even errors, such as those referred to in note (<span class =
"smallroman">VII</span>) to the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, and
notes (<span class = "smallroman">I</span>) and (<span class =
"smallroman">X</span>) to the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, because we
thought them to be Shakespeare’s own blunders, have been allowed to
stand. But many phrases that are called bad grammar by us, and rightly
so called, were sanctioned by usage among the contemporaries of
Shakespeare, especially, no doubt, by the usage of conversation,
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "page_xiv" id = "page_xiv"> </a>
even among educated persons. And as a learned correspondent (Dr&nbsp;B.
Nicholson) remarks, this would naturally be the style of English which
Shakespeare would purposely use in dramatic dialogue.</p>

<p>As examples of the anomalies of grammar sanctioned by Elizabethan
usage we may mention:&mdash;</p>

<p>Singular verbs, with plural nouns, especially when the verb precedes
its nominative:</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>Hath all his ventures failed? What; not one hit?</p>
<p class = "half">
<i>Merchant of Venice</i>, <span class = "smallroman">III.</span> 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Nominatives for accusatives:</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>She should this Angelo have married.</p>
<p class = "half">
<i>Measure for Measure</i>, <span class = "smallroman">III.</span> 1.
204.</p>
</div>

<p class = "nospace">
And repeatedly ‘who’ for ‘whom.’</p>

<p>Omission of prepositions:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Most ignorant of what he’s most assured. &nbsp; <i>Ibid.</i> <span class
= "smallroman">II.</span>&nbsp;2. 119.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span> which now you censure
him. &nbsp; <i>Ibid.</i> <span class =
"smallroman">II.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;15.</p>

<p>The changes of accidence are less frequent than those of syntax, yet
such occur. In the Folios verbs ending in <i>d</i> and <i>t</i> are
constantly found making their second persons singular in <i>ds</i> and
<i>ts</i> instead of <i>d’st</i> and <i>t’st</i>. This was a corruption
coming into vogue about the time of their publication, and in the
earlier Quartos we frequently find the correct form; for example, in
<i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">V.</span>&nbsp;1: ‘standst’ in Q<sub>1</sub> is corrupted
to ‘stands’ in Q<sub>2</sub> and in Ff. We have therefore confidently
replaced the correct form for the incorrect, even without authority to
back us; looking upon the variation as a corrupt abbreviation of
spelling.</p>

<p>But, in general, our practice has been not to alter the text, in
order to make the grammar conform to the fixed rules of modern English.
A&nbsp;wide latitude of speech was allowed in Shakespeare’s age both as
to spelling and grammar.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "page_xv" id = "page_xv"> </a>
<h5>C. <i>Orthography.</i></h5>

<p>It was not without much consideration that we determined to adopt the
spelling of the nineteenth century. If we had any evidence as to
Shakespeare’s own spelling, we should have been strongly inclined to
adopt it, but to attempt to reproduce it, by operating by rule upon the
texts that have come down to us, would be subjecting Shakespeare’s
English to arbitrary laws, of which it never yet was conscious. This
argues no want of education on the part of Shakespeare; for if Lord
Bacon himself had rules for spelling, they were but few, as we may
easily perceive by inspection of his works published under his own eye.
But if we have not Shakespeare’s own spelling to guide us, what other
spelling shall we adopt? Every student of Shakespeare has now an easy
opportunity of acquainting himself with the text of F<sub>1</sub>, by
means of Mr Booth’s excellent reprint, and we are certain that not one
of them will consider the spelling of that volume intrinsically better
than that of our day. Rather more like Shakespeare’s it certainly is,
but we doubt whether much is gained by such approximation, as long as it
is short of perfect attainment. Moreover, in many of the Plays there is
a competing claim to guide our spelling, put forward by an array of
Quartos, of earlier date than F<sub>1</sub>. To desert F<sub>1</sub> for
these, where they exist, would be but an occasional, and at best an
uncertain means of attaining the lost spelling of Shakespeare, while the
spelling of our volume would become even more inconsistent than that of
F<sub>1</sub> itself. Add to this; there are places, though, as has been
seen, not many, where we have had to leave the reading of F<sub>1</sub>
altogether. How then shall we spell the correction which we
substitute?</p>


<h5>D. <i>Metre.</i></h5>

<p>Corrections of metre are avoided even more carefully than those of
grammar. For the rules of prosody have
<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<a name = "page_xvi" id = "page_xvi"> </a>
undergone perhaps greater change than those of grammar. There is no
doubt that a system of versification has taken root among us very
different from that which was in use in the earlier days of our poetry.
The influence of classical prosody has worked in a manner that could
hardly have been expected. Quantity in the sense in which the Greeks and
Romans understood it, is altogether foreign to our speech; and our
poets, willing to imitate the verse regulated by laws of quantity, have
partially adopted those laws, substituting for long syllables those that
bear a stress of accent or emphasis.</p>

<p>In Greek and Latin accent was essentially distinct from quantity, and
verse was regulated entirely by the latter. In the modern imitation of
classical metres, for want of appreciation of quantity, we go entirely
by accent or emphasis, and make precisely such verses as classical taste
eschewed. Thus we have learned to scan lines by iambuses, or rather by
their accentual imitations, and a perfect line would consist of ten
syllables, of which the alternate ones bore a rhythmical stress. These
iambuses may, under certain restrictions, be changed for ‘trochees,’ and
out of these two ‘feet,’ or their representatives, a&nbsp;metre,
certainly very beautiful, has grown up gradually, which attained perhaps
its greatest perfection in the verse of Pope. But the poets of this
metre, like renaissance architects, lost all perception of the laws of
the original artists, and set themselves, whenever it was possible, to
convert the original verses into such as their own system would have
produced. We see the beginnings of this practice even in the first
Folio, when there exist Quartos to exhibit it. In each successive Folio
the process has been continued. Rowe’s few changes of F<sub>4</sub> are
almost all in the same direction, and the work may be said to have been
completed by Hanmer. It is to be feared that a result of two centuries
of such a practice has been to bring about an idea of Shakespearian
versification very different from Shakespeare’s. But we feel a
<span class = "pagenum">xvii</span>
<a name = "page_xvii" id = "page_xvii"> </a>
hope that the number of Shakespeare’s students who can appreciate the
true nature of the English versification in our elder poets is
increasing, and will increase more as the opportunity is furnished them
of studying Shakespeare himself.</p>

<p>Of course we do not mean to give here an essay on Shakespearian
versification. Those who would study it may best be referred to Capell,
in spite of the erroneous taste of his day, to Sidney Walker, and
especially, if they are earnest students, to Dr Guest’s <i>History of
English Rhythms</i>.</p>

<p>We will only state some of the differences between Shakespearian
versification and that which has now become our normal prosody; namely,
such as have excited an ambition of correcting in later editors. There
is a large number of verses which a modern ear pronounces to want their
first unaccented syllable. The following we quote as they appear in
F<sub>1</sub>, in the opening of the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
No, I will not, for it boots thee not. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;28.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;30.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Is’t near dinner-time? I would it were. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;67.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
These lines are all corrected by editors; and it is evident that there
would be little trouble in altering all such lines wherever they occur:
or they may be explained away, as for instance in the second cited,
‘fire’ doubtless is sometimes pronounced as a dissyllable. Yet to
attempt correction or explanation wherever such lines occur would be
ill-spent labour. A&nbsp;very impressive line in the <i>Tempest</i> is
similarly scanned:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;53.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
Where we are rightly told that ‘year’ may be a dissyllable. Yet that one
word should bear two pronunciations in one line is far more improbable
than that the unaccented syllable before ‘twelve’ is purposely omitted
by the poet;
<span class = "pagenum">xviii</span>
<a name = "page_xviii" id = "page_xviii"> </a>
and few readers will not acknowledge the solemn effect of such a verse.
As another example with a contrary effect, of impulsive abruptness, we
may take a line in <i>Measure for Measure</i>:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;88.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
This last example is also an instance of another practice, by modern
judgement a license, viz. making a line end with two unaccented
‘extrametrical’ syllables.</p>

<p>Two very effective lines together, commencing similarly to the last,
are in the same Play:</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>Take him hence; to the rack with him! We’ll touse you</p>
<p>Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">V.</span>&nbsp;1. 309, 310.</p>
</div>

<p>Another irregularity is a single strong syllable commencing a line
complete without it. This might often be printed in a line by itself.
For example:</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>Ay,</p>
<p>And we’re betrothed: nay more, our marriage-hour&mdash;</p>
<p class = "half">
<i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <span class = "smallroman">II.</span> 4,
175.</p>
</div>

<p>Another irregularity is the insertion of syllables in the middle of
lines. The dramatic verse is doubtless descended from the Old English
decasyllables of Chaucer, and that his verse was divided actually into
two sections is evinced by the punctuation of some MSS. The
<i>licenses</i> accorded to the beginnings and endings of the whole
verse were also allowed, with some modification, to the end and
beginnings of these <i>sections</i>, and accordingly, in early poetry,
many verses will appear to a modern reader to have a syllable too many
or too few in the part where his ear teaches him to place a cæsura.
Exactly similarly, but more sparingly, syllables are omitted or inserted
at the central pause of Shakespeare’s verse, especially when this pause
is not merely metrical, but is in the place of a stop of greater or less
duration; and most freely when the line in question is broken by the
dialogue.</p>

<p>The following examples of a superfluous syllable at
<span class = "pagenum">xix</span>
<a name = "page_xix" id = "page_xix"> </a>
the middle pause are taken out of the beginning of the
<i>Tempest</i>:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember? &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;38.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
But blessedly help hither. O, my heart bleeds. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;63.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Without a parallel; those being all my study. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;74.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
With all prerogative:&mdash;hence his ambition growing. &nbsp; <span
class = "smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2. 105.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
The extra syllables may be at the commencement of the second
section:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
He was indeed the Duke; out o’ the substitution. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2. 103.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
And the following are defective of a syllable:</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p class = "poem nospace">
Make the prize light. One word more; I charge thee. &nbsp; <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2. 452.</p>

<p class = "nospace">
To these ‘licenses’ we may add verses sometimes with one and sometimes
with two additional feet, and many half verses, and some a foot too
short. When these inequalities are allowed, the reader will perceive
much simpler and more general methods of scanning some lines supposed to
be unmetrical than the Procrustean means adopted by Sidney Walker for
reducing or multiplying the number of syllables in words.</p>


<h5>E. <i>Punctuation.</i></h5>

<p>We have now to state our practice of punctuation. The Folio and other
editions, starting with very different principles from those that guide
the punctuation of this day, have acted on those principles with
exceeding incorrectness. Questions are marked and unnoticed almost at
random; stops are inserted in the ends of lines fatal to the sense. In
fact, in many places, we may almost say that a complete want of points
would mislead us less than the punctuation of the Folios. The
consequence is, that our punctuation is very little dependent upon the
Folios and Quartos, but generally follows the practice which has taken
possession of the text of Shakespeare, under
<span class = "pagenum">xx</span>
<a name = "page_xx" id = "page_xx"> </a>
the arrangement of the best editors, from Pope to Dyce and Staunton.
Only for an obvious improvement have we altered the punctuation on our
own judgement, and in most cases the alteration is recorded in the
notes.</p>

<p>One thing remains to be said in reference to our text. It is well
known, that in James the First’s reign, a&nbsp;statute was passed for
exscinding profane expressions from plays. In obedience to this many
passages in the Folios have been altered with an over-scrupulous care.
When we have seen the metre, or, as is sometimes the case, even the
sense marred by these changes, and the original contains no offensive
profanity, we have recalled Shakespeare’s words.</p>

<p class = "space">
Our object in the foot-notes has been (1) to state the authority upon
which a received reading rests, (2)&nbsp;to give all different readings
adopted into the text by other editors, and (3)&nbsp;to give all
emendations suggested by commentators.</p>

<p>When no authority is mentioned for the reading of the text, it must
be understood that all the Folios agree in it, as well as all editors
previous to the one mentioned, as authority for an alteration. Thus, in
the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;71, ‘<i>cake here</i>] <i>cake</i>
Capell’ indicates that ‘cake here’ is the reading of the four Folios, of
Rowe, Pope, Theobald Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson.</p>

<p>Mere differences of spelling are not noticed, except (1) in corrupt
or disputed passages, where the ‘ductus literarum’ is important as a
help towards the determination of the true text, and (2)&nbsp;when the
variation is interesting etymologically or characteristic of a
particular edition.</p>

<p>In the same way, differences of punctuation are recorded only when
they make a difference in the sense, or when they may serve as a guide
to the restoration of some corrupt, or the explanation of some
difficult, passage.</p>

<p>Misprints also are passed over as a general rule. We
<span class = "pagenum">xxi</span>
<a name = "page_xxi" id = "page_xxi"> </a>
have noticed them occasionally, when they appeared to be remarkable as
indicating the amount of error of which the old printers were
capable.</p>

<p>We have endeavoured faithfully to record any variation of reading,
however minute (except, as before said, mere differences of spelling or
punctuation), adopted by any editor, and to give that editor’s name.
Sometimes, however, we have passed over in silence merely arbitrary
rearrangements of the metre made in passages where no change was
required and no improvement effected.</p>

<p>In recording conjectures, we have excepted only (1) those which were
so near some other reading previously adopted or suggested, as to be
undeserving of separate record, and (2)&nbsp;a&nbsp;few (of Becket,
Jackson, and others) which were palpably erroneous. Even of these we
have given a sufficient number to serve as samples.</p>

<p>We will now proceed to explain the notation employed in the
foot-notes, which, in some cases, the necessity of compressing may have
rendered obscure.</p>

<p>The <a name = "page_xxi_ref" id = "page_xxi_ref">four Folios</a> are
designated respectively by the letters F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>,
F<sub>3</sub>, and F<sub>4</sub>, and the quarto editions of separate
plays, in each case, by the letters Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>,
Q<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When one or more of the Quartos differ so widely from the Folios that
a complete collation is impossible, the letters which designate them are
put between brackets, for the sake of keeping this difference before the
mind of the reader. Thus, in the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, the two
earliest Quartos differ widely from the Folios, while the third Quarto
(1630) is printed from the first Folio. Hence, they are designated thus:
<span class = "smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;20, <i>Cain</i>]
F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>. <i>Kane</i> (Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>2</sub>).
<i>Caine</i> F<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>3</sub> F<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>When no authority is given for the reading in the text, it is to be
understood that it is derived from such of the Folios as are not
subsequently mentioned. Thus, in the <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, <span
class = "smallroman">II.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;203, <i>the eye</i>] <i>thy
eye</i> F<sub>2</sub> F<sub>3</sub> indicates that F<sub>1</sub> and
F<sub>4</sub> agree in reading ‘the eye.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxii</span>
<a name = "page_xxii" id = "page_xxii"> </a>
<p>In the same scene, line 191, the note ‘<i>or</i>] <i>and</i>
Theobald’ means, that the four Folios, followed by Rowe and Pope, agree
in reading ‘or.’</p>

<p>When the difference between the reading adopted and that given in one
or more of the Folios is a mere difference of spelling, it has not been
thought worth while to record the name of the first editor who
modernized it: for instance, in the <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>,
<span class = "smallroman">II.</span>&nbsp;6.&nbsp;35, the note is:
<i>counsel</i>] <i>counsaile</i> F<sub>1</sub> F<sub>2</sub>.
<i>councel</i> F<sub>3</sub>. <i>council</i> F<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>We have given at full the name of the editor who first introduced a
particular reading, without recording which of his successors adopted
it. Thus, in <i>Measure for Measure</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">III.</span>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;138, ‘grant’ for ‘shield’ is read
by Pope, Theobald, Hanmer, Warburton, and others, but the first only is
mentioned: ‘<i>shield</i>] F<sub>1</sub>. <i>shield:</i> F<sub>2</sub>
F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>. <i>grant</i> Pope.’</p>

<p>The conjectures made by annotators or by editors, but not introduced
by them into the text, are distinguished by the addition of ‘conj.,’ as
‘Farmer conj.,’ ‘Johnson conj.’ &amp;c. ‘Steevens (Farmer conj.)’
indicates that the reading in question was first suggested by Farmer,
and first introduced into the text by Steevens. If, however, the person
who first made the conjecture, afterwards became an editor, and gave it
in his own text, while, in the mean time, it had been adopted by some
other editor, the ‘conj.’ is omitted. Thus, for example, ‘Theobald
(Warburton)’ shows that Warburton was the first to propose such and such
a change, that Theobald first incorporated it in the text, and that
Warburton afterwards gave it in the text of his own edition. We have
designated the readings derived from Mr Collier’s corrected copy of the
second folio thus: ‘Collier MS.’ not ‘Collier MS. conj.,’ as in this
case we could consult brevity without danger of misleading any one.</p>

<p>We have arranged the names both of Editors and of Commentators (as
far as was possible) in order of time. It has frequently happened that
several persons have hit on the same conjecture independently. In such
cases we have
<span class = "pagenum">xxiii</span>
<a name = "page_xxiii" id = "page_xxiii"> </a>
assigned it to the earliest, determining the priority by the date of
publication.</p>

<p>The metrical arrangement of each passage is marked in the notes by
printing each word which commences a line with an initial capital
letter. In the Folios, many substantives, other than proper names or
titles, are printed with initial capitals; but, in order to avoid
ambiguity, we have generally made our quotations conform, in this
respect, to the modern usage.</p>

<p>We had originally intended to give in our Preface a catalogue
raisonné of all the editions of our author and other books used by us in
the preparation of the present work, but this labour has been
fortunately spared us by Mr Bohn’s reissue of Lowndes’s
<i>Bibliographer’s Manual</i>, the eighth part of which contains a full
and accurate account of Shakespearian literature. To that work we refer
our readers for more complete bibliographical details, and propose to
confine ourselves to some remarks on the critical value of the principal
editions and commentaries. We have, of course, confined our collation to
those editions which seemed to possess an independent value of their
own. Mr Bohn enumerates two hundred and sixty-two different editions of
Shakespeare. It was therefore a matter of necessity to make a selection.
In the following remarks we pass briefly in review the editions which we
have habitually consulted.</p>

<p>Whenever any commentary was known to us to exist in a separate form,
we have always, if possible, procured it. In some few instances, we have
been obliged to take the references at second-hand.</p>

<p>The first Folio (F<sub>1</sub>), 1623, contains all the plays usually
found in modern editions of Shakespeare, except <i>Pericles</i>. It was
‘published according to the True Originall Copies,’ and ‘set forth’ by
his ‘friends’ and ‘fellows,’ John Heminge and Henry Condell, the author
‘not having the fate common with some to be exequutor to his own
writings.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxiv</span>
<a name = "page_xxiv" id = "page_xxiv"> </a>
<p>In an address ‘To the great variety of Readers’ following the
dedication to the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, the following
passage occurs:</p>

<p>‘It had bene a thing, we confesse, worthie to have bene wished, that
the Author himselfe had liv’d to have set forth, and overseen his owne
writings; But since it hath bin ordain’d otherwise, and he by death
departed from that right, we pray you do not envie his Friends, the
office of their care, and paine, to have collected &amp; publish’d them;
and so to have publish’d them, as where (before) you were abus’d with
diverse stolne and surreptitious copies, maimed, and deformed by the
frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors, that expos’d them: even
those are now offer’d to your view cur’d, and perfect of their limbes;
and all the rest, absolute in their numbers, as he conceived them. Who,
as he was a happie imitator of Nature, was a most gentle expresser of
it. His mind and hand went together: And what he thought, he uttered
with that easinesse, that wee have scarse received from him a blot in
his papers.’</p>

<p>The natural inference to be drawn from this statement is, that all
the separate editions of Shakespeare’s plays were ‘stolen,’<ins class =
"correction" title = "open quote missing"> ‘</ins>surreptitious,’ and
‘imperfect,’ and that all those published in the Folio were printed from
the author’s own manuscripts. But it can be proved to demonstration that
several of the plays in the Folio were printed from earlier Quarto
editions, and that in other cases the Quarto is more correctly printed
or from a better MS. than the Folio text, and therefore of higher
authority. For example, in <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, in <i>Love’s
Labour’s Lost</i>, and in <i>Richard the Second</i>, the reading of the
Quarto is almost always preferable to that of the Folio, and in
<i>Hamlet</i> we have computed that the Folio, when it differs from the
Quartos, differs for the worse in forty-seven places, while it differs
for the better in twenty at most.</p>

<p>As the ‘setters forth’ are thus convicted of a ‘suggestio falsi’ in
one point, it is not improbable that they may
<span class = "pagenum">xxv</span>
<a name = "page_xxv" id = "page_xxv"> </a>
have been guilty of the like in another. Some of the plays may have been
printed not from Shakespeare’s own manuscript, but from transcripts made
from them for the use of the theatre. And this hypothesis will account
for strange errors found in some of the plays&mdash;errors too gross to
be accounted for by the negligence of a printer, especially if the
original MS. was as unblotted as Heminge and Condell describe it to have
been. Thus too we may explain the great difference in the state of the
text as found in different plays. It is probable that this deception
arose not from deliberate design on the part of Heminge and
Condell,&mdash;whom as having been Shakespeare’s friends and fellows we
like to think of as honourable men,&mdash;but partly at least from want
of practice in composition, and from the wish rather to write a smart
preface in praise of the book than to state the facts clearly and
simply. Or the preface may have been written by some literary man in the
employment of the publishers, and merely signed by the two players.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, their duties as editors were probably limited to
correcting and arranging the manuscripts and sending them to the press.
The ‘overseeing’ of which they speak, probably meant a revision of the
MSS., not a correction of the press, for it does not appear that there
were any proof sheets in those days sent either to author or editor.
Indeed we consider it as certain that, after a MS. had been sent to
press, it was seen only by the printers and one or more correctors of
the press, regularly employed by the publishers for that purpose<a class
= "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a>.</p>

<p>The opinions of critics have varied very much as to the merits of the
first Folio, some praising it as among the most correct, and others
blaming it as one of the most incorrect editions of its time. The truth
seems to be that it is of very varied excellence, differing from time to
time
<span class = "pagenum">xxvi</span>
<a name = "page_xxvi" id = "page_xxvi"> </a>
according to the state of the MS. from which it was printed, the skill
of the compositor, and the diligence of the corrector. There is the
widest difference, for instance, between the text of the <i>Two
Gentlemen of Verona</i> and that of <i>All’s well that ends
well</i>.</p>

<p>As is the case with most books of that time<a class = "tag" name =
"tag4" id = "tag4" href = "#note4">4</a>, different copies of the first
Folio are found to vary here and there; generally, however, in a single
letter only. It is probable that no one copy exactly corresponds with
any other copy. We have indicated these variations, wherever they were
known to us, in a note either at the foot of the page or at the end of
each play.</p>

<p>A reprint of the first Folio, not free from inaccuracies, was
published in 1807. A&nbsp;second reprint is now in course of publication
by Mr Lionel Booth. The first part, containing the Comedies, has already
appeared. It is probably the most correct reprint ever issued.</p>

<p>The second Folio (F<sub>2</sub>) is a reprint of the first,
preserving the same pagination. It differs, however, from the first in
many passages, sometimes widely, sometimes slightly, sometimes by
accident, sometimes by design. The emendations are evidently
conjectural, and though occasionally right, appear more frequently to be
wrong. They deserve no more respect than those of other guessers, except
such as is due to their author’s familiar acquaintance with the language
and customs of Shakespeare’s day, and possible knowledge of the acted
plays.</p>

<p>Capell’s copy of the second Folio has been of great use to us in our
collations. He has annotated the margin with a multitude of marks in red
ink,&mdash;conventional symbols indicating where and how it differs from
the first. We have hardly in a single instance found his accuracy at
fault.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxvii</span>
<a name = "page_xxvii" id = "page_xxvii"> </a>
<p>The third Folio (F<sub>3</sub>) was first published in 1663, and
reissued in the following year with a new title-page<a class = "tag"
name = "tag5" id = "tag5" href = "#note5">5</a>, and with seven
additional plays, viz.: <i>Pericles, Prince of Tyre</i>: <i>The London
Prodigal</i>: <i>The History of the Life and Death of Thomas Lord
Cromwell</i>: <i>The History of Sir John Oldcastle, the good Lord
Cobham</i>: <i>The Puritan Widow</i>: <i>A Yorkshire Tragedy</i>: and
<i>The Tragedy of Locrine</i>. With regard to the plays which it
contains in common with the former Folios, it is on the whole a
tolerably faithful reprint of the second, correcting, however, some
obvious errors, making now and then an uncalled-for alteration, and
occasionally modernizing the spelling of a word. The printer of course
has committed some errors of his own.</p>

<p>The fourth Folio (F<sub>4</sub>) was printed from the third, but with
a different pagination, in 1685. The spelling is very much modernized,
but we have not been able to detect any other evidence of editorial
care.</p>

<p>The first octavo edition was that of Nicholas Rowe, published in
1709, dedicated to the Duke of Somerset, in words which we take pleasure
in recording: ‘’Tis the best security a poet can ask for to be sheltered
under that great name which presides over one of the most famous
Universities of Europe.’ It contained all the plays in the fourth Folio
in the same order, except that the seven spurious plays were transferred
from the beginning to the end. The poems were added also.</p>

<p>It is evident that Rowe took the fourth Folio as the text from which
his edition was printed, and it is almost certain that he did not take
the trouble to refer to, much less to collate, any of the previous
Folios or Quartos. It seems, however, while the volume containing
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was in the press he learned the existence of a
Quarto edition, for he has printed the prologue given in the
<span class = "pagenum">xxviii</span>
<a name = "page_xxviii" id = "page_xxviii"> </a>
Quartos and omitted in the Folios, at the end of the play. He did not
take the trouble to compare the text of the Quarto with that of
F<sub>4</sub>. When any emendation introduced by him in the text
coincides with the reading of F<sub>1</sub>, as sometimes happens, we
are convinced that it is an accidental coincidence. Being, however,
a&nbsp;man of natural ability and taste he improved the text by some
happy guesses, while, from overhaste and negligence, he left it still
deformed by many palpable errors. The best part of the work is that with
which his experience of the stage as a dramatic poet had made him
familiar. In many cases he first prefixed to the play a list of dramatis
personæ, he supplied the defects of the Folios in the division and
numbering of Acts and Scenes, and in the entrances and exits of
characters. He also corrected and further modernized the spelling, the
punctuation, and the grammar.</p>

<p>A characteristic specimen of blunders and corrections occurs in the
<i>Comedy of Errors</i>, <span class = "smallroman">V.</span> 1.
138.</p>

<p><i>important</i>] F<sub>1</sub> <i>impoteant</i> F<sub>2</sub>.
<i>impotent</i> F<sub>3</sub> F<sub>4</sub>. <i>all-potent</i> Rowe.</p>

<p>A second Edition, 9 Volumes 12mo, was published in 1714.</p>

<p>Pope’s edition in six volumes, 4to, was completed in 1715. On the
title-page we read, ‘The Works of Shakespeare, in six volumes.’ The six
volumes, however, included only the plays contained in the first and
second Folios. The poems, with an <i>Essay on the Rise and Progress of
the Stage</i>, and a Glossary, were contained in a seventh volume edited
by Dr Sewell.</p>

<p>Pope, unlike his predecessor, had at least seen the first Folio and
some of the Quartos of separate plays, and from the following passage of
his preface it might have been inferred that he had diligently collated
them all:</p>

<p>‘This is the state in which Shakespeare’s writings be at present; for
since the above-mentioned folio edition [<i>i.e.</i> F<sub>4</sub>], all
the rest have implicitly followed it without
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
<a name = "page_xxix" id = "page_xxix"> </a>
having recourse to any of the former, or ever making the comparison
between them. It is impossible to repair the injuries already done him;
too much time has elaps’d, and the materials are too few. In what I have
done I have rather given a proof of my willingness and desire, than of
my ability, to do him justice. I&nbsp;have discharg’d the dull duty of
an editor, to my best judgment, with more labour than I expect thanks,
with a religious abhorrence of all innovation, and without any
indulgence to my private sense or conjecture. The method taken in this
edition will show itself. The various readings are fairly put in the
margin, so that every one may compare ’em, and those I prefer’d into the
text are constantly <i>ex fide codicum</i>, upon authority.’</p>

<p>This passage, as any one may see who examines the text, is much more
like a description of what the editor did <i>not</i> do than of what he
did. Although in many instances he restored, from some Quarto, passages
which had been omitted in the Folio, it is very rarely indeed that we
find any evidence of his having collated either the first Folio or any
Quarto, with proper care. The ‘innovations’ which he made, according to
his own ‘private sense and conjecture,’ are extremely numerous. Not one
in twenty of the various readings is put in the margin, and the readings
in his text very frequently rest upon no authority whatever. The glaring
inconsistency between the promise in the preface and the performance in
the book may well account for its failure with the public.</p>

<p>It would, however, be ungrateful not to acknowledge that Pope’s
emendations are always ingenious and plausible, and sometimes
unquestionably true. He never seems to nod over that ‘dull labour’ of
which he complains. His acuteness of perception is never at fault.</p>

<p>What is said of him in the preface to Theobald’s edition is, in this
point, very unjust<a class = "tag" name = "tag6" id = "tag6" href =
"#note6">6</a>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
<a name = "page_xxx" id = "page_xxx"> </a>

<p>‘They have both (<i>i.e.</i> Pope and Rymer<a class = "tag" name =
"tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a>) shown themselves in an equal
<i>impuissance</i> of suspecting or amending the corrupted passages,
&amp;c.’</p>

<p>Pope was the first to indicate the <i>place</i> of each new scene;
as, for instance, <i>Tempest</i>, <span class =
"smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;1. ‘On a ship at sea.’ He also subdivided
the scenes as given by the Folios and Rowe, making a fresh scene
whenever a new character entered&mdash;an arrangement followed by
Hanmer, Warburton, and Johnson. For convenience of reference to these
editions, we have always recorded the commencement of Pope’s scenes.</p>

<p>By a minute comparison of the two texts we find that Pope printed his
edition from Rowe, not from any of the Folios.</p>

<p>A second edition, 10 volumes, 12mo, was published in 1728, ‘by Mr
Pope and Dr Sewell.’ In this edition, after Pope’s preface, reprinted,
comes: ‘A table of the several editions of Shakespeare’s plays, made use
of and compared in this impression.’ Then follows a list containing the
first and second Folios, and twenty-eight Quarto editions of separate
plays. It does not, however, appear that even the first Folio was
compared with any care, for the changes made in this second edition are
very few.</p>

<p>Lewis Theobald had the misfortune to incur the enmity of one who was
both the most popular poet, and, if not the first, at least the second,
satirist of his time. The main cause of offence was Theobald’s
<i>Shakespeare Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors committed as
well as unamended by Mr Pope in his late edition of this Poet</i>, 1726.
Theobald was also in the habit of communicating notes on
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
<a name = "page_xxxi" id = "page_xxxi"> </a>
passages of Shakespeare to <i>Mist’s Journal</i>, a&nbsp;weekly Tory
paper. Hence he was made the hero of the <i>Dunciad</i> till dethroned
in the fourth edition to make way for Cibber; hence, too, the allusions
in that poem:</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>‘There hapless Shakespear, yet of Theobald sore,</p>
<p>Wish’d he had blotted for himself before;’</p>
</div>

<p class = "nospace">
and, in the earlier editions,</p>

<div class = "poem nospace">
<p>‘Here studious I unlucky moderns save,</p>

Pope’s editors and commentators, adopting their author’s quarrel, have
spoken of Theobald as ‘Tibbald, a&nbsp;cold, plodding, and tasteless
writer and critic.’ These are Warton’s words. A&nbsp;more unjust
sentence was never penned. Theobald, as an Editor, is incomparably
superior to his predecessors, and to his immediate successor, Warburton,
although the latter had the advantage of working on his materials. He
was the first to recal a multitude of readings of the first Folio
unquestionably right, but unnoticed by previous editors. Many most
brilliant emendations, such as could not have suggested themselves to a
mere ‘cold, plodding, and tasteless critic,’ are due to him. If he
sometimes erred&mdash;‘humanum est.’ It is remarkable that with all his
minute diligence<a class = "tag" name = "tag8" id = "tag8" href =
"#note8">8</a>, (which even his enemies conceded to him, or rather of
which they accused him) he left a goodly number of genuine readings from
the first Folio to be gleaned by the still more minutely diligent
Capell. It is to be regretted that he gave up numbering the scenes,
which makes his edition difficult to refer to. It was first
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
<a name = "page_xxxii" id = "page_xxxii"> </a>
published in 1733, in seven volumes, 8vo. A&nbsp;second, 8 volumes,
12mo, appeared in 1740.</p>

<p>In 1744, a new edition of Shakespeare’s Works, in six volumes, 4to,
was published at Oxford. It appeared with a kind of sanction from the
University, as it was printed at the Theatre, with the Imprimatur of the
Vice-Chancellor, and had no publisher’s name on the title-page. The
Editor is not named&mdash;hence he is frequently referred to by
subsequent critics as ‘the Oxford Editor’;&mdash;but as he was well
known to be Sir Thomas Hanmer, we have always referred to the book under
his name. We read in the preface: ‘What the Publick is here to expect is
a true and correct Edition of Shakespear’s Works, cleared from the
corruptions with which they have hitherto abounded. One of the great
admirers of this incomparable author hath made it the amusement of his
leisure hours for many years past to look over his writings with a
careful eye, to note the obscurities and absurdities introduced into the
text, and according to the best of his judgment to restore the genuine
sense and purity of it. In this he proposed nothing to himself but his
private satisfaction in making his own copy as perfect as he could; but
as the emendations multiplied upon his hands, other Gentlemen equally
fond of the Author, desired to see them, and some were so kind as to
give their assistance by communicating their observations and
conjectures upon difficult passages which had occurred to them.’</p>

<p>From this passage the character of the edition may be inferred.
A&nbsp;country gentleman of great ingenuity and lively fancy, but with
no knowledge of older literature, no taste for research, and no ear for
the rhythm of earlier English verse, amused his leisure hours by
scribbling down his own and his friends’ guesses in Pope’s Shakespeare,
and with this <i>apparatus criticus</i>, if we may believe Warburton,
‘when that illustrious body, the University of Oxford, in their public
capacity, undertook an edition
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
<a name = "page_xxxiii" id = "page_xxxiii"> </a>
of Shakespeare by subscription,’ Sir T.&nbsp;Hanmer ‘thrust himself into
the employment.’</p>

<p>Whether from the sanction thus given, or from its typographical
beauty, or from the plausibility of its new readings, this edition
continued in favour, and even ‘rose to the price of 10<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> before it was reprinted in 1770-1, while Pope’s, in quarto,
at the same period sold off at Tonson’s sale for 16<i>s.</i> per copy.’
Bohn, p. 2260.</p>

<p>In 1747, three years after Pope’s death, another edition of
Shakespeare based upon his appeared, edited by Mr Warburton.</p>

<p>On the title-page are these words: ‘The Genuine Text (collated with
all the former Editions, and then corrected and emended) is here
settled: Being restored from the <i>Blunders</i> of the first Editors,
and the <i>Interpolations</i> of the two Last: with a Comment and Notes,
Critical and Explanatory. By Mr Pope and Mr Warburton<a class = "tag"
name = "tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a>.’</p>

<p>The latter, in his preface, vehemently attacks Theobald and Hanmer,
accusing both of plagiarism and even fraud. ‘The one was recommended to
me as a poor Man, the other as a poor Critic: and to each of them, at
different times, I&nbsp;communicated a great number of Observations,
which they managed as they saw fit to the Relief of their several
distresses. As to Mr <i>Theobald</i>, who wanted Money, I&nbsp;allowed
him to print what I gave him for his own Advantage: and he allowed
himself in the Liberty of taking one Part for his own, and sequestering
another for the Benefit, as I supposed, of some future Edition. But as
to the <i>Oxford Editor</i>, who wanted nothing, but what he might very
well be without, the reputation of a Critic, I&nbsp;could not so easily
forgive him for trafficking in my Papers without my knowledge; and when
that Project fail’d, for employing a number of my Conjectures in his
Edition against my express Desire not to have that Honour done
unto&nbsp;me.’</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
<a name = "page_xxxiv" id = "page_xxxiv"> </a>
<p>Again he says of Hanmer: ‘Having a number of my Conjectures before
him, he took as many as he saw fit to work upon, and by changing them to
something, he thought, synonimous or similar, he made them his own,’
&amp;c. &amp;c. p. xii.</p>

<p>Of his own performance Warburton says, ‘The Notes in this Edition
take in the whole Compass of Criticism. The first sort is employed in
restoring the Poet’s genuine Text; but in those places only where it
labours with inextricable Nonsense. In which, how much soever I may have
given scope to critical Conjecture, when the old Copies failed me,
I&nbsp;have indulged nothing to Fancy or Imagination; but have
religiously observed the severe Canons of literal Criticism, &amp;c.
&amp;c.’ p. xiv. Yet further on he says, ‘These, such as they are, were
amongst my younger amusements, when, many years ago I used to turn over
these sort of Writers to unbend myself from more serious
applications.’</p>

<p>The excellence of the edition proved to be by no means proportionate
to the arrogance of the editor. His text is, indeed, better than Pope’s,
inasmuch as he introduced many of Theobald’s restorations and some
probable emendations both of his own and of the two editors whom he so
unsparingly denounced, but there is no trace whatever, so far as we have
discovered, of his having collated for himself either the earlier Folios
or any of the Quartos.</p>

<p>Warburton<a class = "tag" name = "tag10" id = "tag10" href =
"#note10">10</a> was, in his turn, severely criticised by Dr Zachary
Grey, and Mr John Upton, in 1746, and still more severely by Mr Thomas
Edwards, in his <i>Supplement to Mr Warburton’s edition of
Shakespeare</i>, 1747. The third edition of Mr Edwards’s book, 1750, was
called <i>Canons of Criticism and Glossary, being a Supplement,
&amp;c.</i> This
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
<a name = "page_xxxv" id = "page_xxxv"> </a>
title is a sarcastic allusion to two passages in Warburton’s preface: ‘I
once intended to have given the Reader a <i>body of Canons</i>, for
literal Criticism, drawn out in form,’ &amp;c. p. xiv, and ‘I had it
once, indeed, in my design, to give a general alphabetic <i>Glossary</i>
of these terms,’ &amp;c. p. xvi. Dr Grey’s attack was reprinted, with
additions, and a new title, in 1751, and again in 1752. Warburton and
his predecessors were passed in review also by Mr Benjamin Heath, in
<i>A Revisal of Shakespeare’s text</i>, 1765.</p>

<p>Dr Samuel Johnson first issued proposals for a new edition of
Shakespeare in 1745, but met with no encouragement. He resumed the
scheme in 1756, and issued a new set of Proposals (reprinted in Malone’s
preface), ‘in which,’ says Boswell, ‘he shewed that he perfectly well
knew what a variety of research such an undertaking required, but his
indolence prevented him from pursuing it with that diligence, which
alone can collect those scattered facts that genius, however acute,
penetrating, and luminous, cannot discover by its own force.’ Johnson
deceived himself so far, as to the work to be done and his own energy in
doing it, that he promised the publication of the whole before the end
of the following year. Yet, though some volumes were printed as early as
1758 (Boswell, Vol. <span class = "smallroman">II.</span> p. 84), it was
not published till 1765, and might never have been published at all, but
for Churchill’s stinging satire:</p>

<div class = "poem">
<p>‘He for subscribers baits his hook,</p>
<p>And takes your cash, but where’s the book?</p>
<p>No matter where; wise fear, you know,</p>
<p>Forbids the robbing of a foe,</p>
<p>But what, to serve our private ends,</p>
<p>Forbids the cheating of our friends?’</p>
</div>

<p>Not only Johnson’s constitutional indolence and desultory habits, but
also the deficiency of his eye-sight, incapacitated him for the task of
minute collation. Nevertheless, he did consult the older copies, and has
the merit of restoring some readings which had escaped Theobald. He had
not systematically studied the literature and language
<span class = "pagenum">xxxvi</span>
<a name = "page_xxxvi" id = "page_xxxvi"> </a>
of the 16th and 17th centuries; he did not always appreciate the
naturalness, simplicity, and humour of his author, but his preface and
notes are distinguished by clearness of thought and diction and by
masterly common sense. He used Warburton’s text, to print his own from.
The readings and suggestions attributed to ‘Johnson,’ in our notes, are
derived either from the edition of 1765, or from those which he
furnished to the subsequent editions in which Steevens was his
co-editor. Some few also found by the latter in Johnson’s hand on the
margin of his copy of ‘Warburton,’ purchased by Steevens at Johnson’s
sale, were incorporated in later editions. Johnson’s edition was
attacked with great acrimony by Dr Kenrick, 1765 (Boswell, Vol. <span
class = "smallroman">II.</span> p. 300). It disappointed the public
expectation, but reached, nevertheless, a&nbsp;second edition in 1768.
Tyrwhitt’s <i>Observations and Conjectures</i> were published
anonymously in 1766.</p>

<p>Capell’s edition (10 volumes, small 8vo) was not published till 1768,
though part of it had gone to press, as the editor himself tells us, in
September, 1760. It contained the Plays in the order of the first and
second Folios, with a preface, of which Dr Johnson said, referring to
<i>Tempest</i>, <span class = "smallroman">I.</span>&nbsp;2.&nbsp;356,
‘The fellow should have come to me, and I would have endowed his purpose
with words. As it is he doth gabble monstrously.’</p>

<p>Defects of style apart, this preface was by far the most valuable
contribution to Shakespearian criticism that had yet appeared, and the
text was based upon a most searching collation of all the Folios and of
all the Quartos known to exist at that time. Capell’s own conjectures,
not always very happy, which he has introduced into his text, are
distinguished by being printed in black letter.</p>

<p>The edition before us contains the scansion of the lines, with
occasional verbal as well as metrical corrections, marked in red ink, in
Capell’s hand. This was done, as he tells us in a note prefixed to Vol.
<span class = "smallroman">I.</span>, in 1769.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxxvii</span>
<a name = "page_xxxvii" id = "page_xxxvii"> </a>
<p>He described, much more minutely than Pope had done, the places of
the scenes, and made many changes, generally for the better, in the
stage directions.</p>

<p>In his peculiar notation, <i>Asides</i> are marked by inverted
commas, and obvious stage business is indicated by an obelus.</p>

<p>In a note to his preface, p. xxiii, Capell says:</p>

<p>‘In the manuscripts from which all these plays are printed, the
emendations are given to their proper owners by initials and other marks
that are in the margin of those manuscripts; but they are suppressed in
the print for two reasons: First their number, in some pages, makes them
a little unsightly; and the editor professes himself weak enough to like
a well-printed book; in the next place, he does declare, that his only
object has been to do service to his Author; which provided it be done,
he thinks it of small importance by what hand the service was
administer’d,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p>By this unfortunate decision, Capell deprived his book of almost all
its interest and value<a class = "tag" name = "tag11" id = "tag11" href
= "#note11">11</a>. And thus his unequalled zeal and industry have never
received from the public the recognition they deserved.</p>

<p>In 1774, a volume of notes<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id =
"tag12" href = "#note12">12</a> was printed in quarto, and in 1783, two
years after his death, appeared <i>Notes, Various Readings, and the
School of Shakespeare</i>, 3 vols. 4to.<a class = "tag" name = "tag13"
id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a> The printing of this work was begun
in 1779.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">xxxviii</span>
<a name = "page_xxxviii" id = "page_xxxviii"> </a>
<p>George Steevens, who had edited in 1766 a reprint of Twenty of the
Plays of Shakespeare from the Quartos, at a time, when, as he himself
afterwards said, he was ‘young and uninformed,’ and had been in the
meanwhile one of Johnson’s most active and useful correspondents, was
formally associated with him as Editor in 1770 (Boswell, Vol. <span
class = "smallroman">III.</span> p. 116). At Steevens’s suggestion,
Johnson wrote to Dr Farmer of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, requesting
him to furnish a Catalogue of all the Translations Shakespeare might
have seen and used. Hence, it seems, Farmer took an interest in the
successive editions, and supplied many valuable notes and acute
conjectural readings. It was on Farmer’s authority that <i>Pericles</i>
has been re-admitted among the Plays of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The first edition of Johnson and Steevens appeared in 1773. The
improvements in this edition, as compared with those which bore
Johnson’s name only, are evidently the work of the new editor, who
brought to the task diligent and methodical habits and great antiquarian
knowledge, thus supplementing the defects of his senior partner.
J.&nbsp;Collins, editor of Capell’s <i>Notes</i> &amp;c. charged
Steevens with plagiarism from Capell. Steevens denied the charge. The
second edition came out in 1778; the third in 1785; and the fourth in
1793. In this edition Steevens made many changes in the text, as if for
the purpose of differing from the cautious Malone, now become a
rival.</p>

<p>Edmond Malone contributed to Steevens his <i>Attempt to ascertain the
order in which the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written</i>; in
1780, published a <i>Supplement</i> to the edition of 1778, containing
the Poems, the seven plays from F<sub>3</sub>, notes, &amp;c., and
moreover distinguished himself by various researches into the history
and literature of the early English stage. He published in 1790 a new
edition of Shakespeare in 10 volumes, 8vo, containing the Plays and
Poems, ‘collated verbatim with the most authentic copies, and revised,’
together with several essay
<span class = "pagenum">xxxix</span>
<a name = "page_xxxix" id = "page_xxxix"> </a>
and dissertations, among the rest that on the order of the plays,
corrected and enlarged.</p>

<p>The animosities which both Steevens and Malone had the misfortune to
excite, have had the effect of throwing some slur on their names as
editors, and even as men, and have prevented the fair appreciation and a
due acknowledgment of the services they rendered jointly and severally
to English literature.</p>

<p>The learning and ability displayed by Malone in denouncing Ireland’s
most clumsy and palpable of frauds, would have sufficed for the
detection of the most cunningly conceived and skilfully executed.</p>

<p>Among the critics of this time may be mentioned (1) Joseph Ritson,
who published in 1783 his <i>Remarks, &amp;c.</i> on the second edition
of Johnson and Steevens, and in 1788, <i>The Quip Modest</i>, on the
third edition, and (2) John Monck Mason, whose <i>Comments</i> appeared
in 1785, and <i>Further Observations</i> in 1798.</p>

<p class = "space">
In 1803 appeared an edition in 21 volumes 8vo, edited by Isaac Reed.
This is called on the title-page ‘the Fifth Edition,’ <i>i.e.</i> of
Johnson and Steevens. It is generally known as the first <i>variorum</i>
edition. Chalmers’s edition, 9 vols. 8vo, 1805, professes to be printed
from the corrected text left by Steevens. The ‘sixth edition’ of Johnson
and Steevens, or the second <i>variorum</i>, appeared in 1813, also
edited by Reed; the ‘seventh,’ or third <i>variorum</i>, in 1821, edited
by James Boswell, from a corrected copy left by Malone.</p>

<p>Among those whose notes were communicated to or collected by various
editors from Johnson to Boswell, the best known names are the following:
Sir William Blackstone, Dr Burney, Bennet Langton, Collins the poet, Sir
J.&nbsp;Hawkins, Musgrave, the editor of <i>Euripides</i>, Dr Percy,
editor of the <i>Reliques</i>, and Thomas Warton. Less known names are:
Blakeway, J.&nbsp;Collins, Henley, Holt White,
<span class = "pagenum">xl</span>

Letherland, Roberts, Seward, Smith, Thirlby, Tollet, and Whalley<a class

<p>Harness’s edition, 8 volumes, 8vo, appeared in 1825.</p>

<p>Of the comments published separately during the present century the
principal are:</p>

<p>1. <i>Remarks, &amp;c.</i>, by E. H. Seymour, 2 vols, 8vo, 1805, in
which are incorporated some notes left by Lord Chedworth.</p>

<p>2. <i>Shakspeare’s himself again</i>, by Andrew Becket, 2 vols, 8vo.
1815. The author has indulged in a license of conjecture and of
interpretation which has never been equalled before or since. We have
nevertheless generally given his conjectures, except when he has gone
the length of inventing a word.</p>

<p>3. <i>Shakspeare’s Genius Justified</i>, by Zachary Jackson, 1 vol.
8vo, 1811. As the author himself had been a printer, his judgement on
the comparative likelihood of this and that typographical error is worth
all consideration. But he sometimes wanders ‘ultra crepidam<a class =
"tag" name = "tag15" id = "tag15" href = "#note15">15</a>.’</p>

<p>Douce’s <i>Illustrations to Shakespeare</i>, 2 vols. 8vo, 1807, ought
to be mentioned as a work of great antiquarian research, though he
rarely suggests any new alteration of the text, and his name therefore
will seldom occur in our notes.</p>

<p class = "space">
The more recent editions of Shakespeare are so well known and so easily
accessible, that it is unnecessary for us, even were it becoming in this
place, to undertake the invidious task of comparing their respective
merits.</p>

<p>It will suffice to mention the names of the editors in the order of
their first editions: S.&nbsp;W. Singer, Charles
<span class = "pagenum">xli</span>
<a name = "page_xli" id = "page_xli"> </a>
Knight, Barry Cornwall, J.&nbsp;Payne Collier, S.&nbsp;Phelps,
J.&nbsp;O. Halliwell, Alex. Dyce, Howard Staunton.</p>

<p>We have also to mention the edition of Delius, 7 vols. 8vo,
Elberfeld, 1854-61, the English text, with concise notes, critical and
explanatory, in German, and that of Mr Richard Grant White (known as the
author of <i>Shakespeare’s Scholar</i>, 1854), published at Boston,
United States, 1857.</p>

<p>In 1853, Mr J. Payne Collier, published in 1 vol. 8vo, <i>Notes and
Emendations to the text of Shakespeare’s Plays, from early manuscript
corrections, in a copy of the Folio 1632</i>, in his own possession. All
the emendations given in this volume by Mr Collier, or subsequently as
an Appendix to Coleridge’s <i>Lectures</i>, except, of course, where
they have been anticipated, have been recorded in our notes.</p>

<p>We have no intention of entering into the controversy respecting the
antiquity and authority of these corrections, nor is it necessary to
enumerate the writings on a subject which is still so fresh in the
memory of all.</p>

<p>M. Tycho Mommsen, of Marburg, who published the most elaborate work
on the so-called ‘Perkins Folio,’ also published in 1859 the text of the
first Quartos of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, with a collation of the
various readings of all editions down to Rowe’s, a&nbsp;full description
of the critical value of the different texts, and an inquiry into the
versification, and incidentally the grammar and orthography of
Shakespeare. The precise rules which he lays down disappear, for the
most part, on a wider induction, and we greatly question whether it be
worth while to register and tabulate such minutiæ as do not represent in
any way Shakespeare’s mind or hand, but only the caprices of this or
that compositor, at a period when spelling, punctuation, and even rules
of grammar, were matters of private judgement.</p>

<p>But M. Mommsen’s industry is beyond praise, and his
<span class = "pagenum">xlii</span>
<a name = "page_xlii" id = "page_xlii"> </a>
practice of using the labours of English Editors, without insulting
them, is worthy of all imitation<a class = "tag" name = "tag16" id =

<p>Among the works to which reference will be found in our edition are
the following:</p>

<p>Coleridge’s <i>Literary Remains</i>: Dr Guest’s <i>History of English
Rhythms</i>: <i>the Versification of Shakespeare</i>, by W.&nbsp;Sidney
Walker, (1854), and <i>Criticisms</i>, by the same, 3&nbsp;vols., post
8vo, (1860), edited by Mr Lettsom, who has also contributed in his notes
some suggestions for the improvement of the text. It is to be regretted
that these volumes have not been accompanied by an Index. Dr. Charles
Badham’s article in the <i>Cambridge Essays</i>, 1856, contains many
ingenious suggestions.</p>

<p>We have borrowed from several literary journals, the <i>Athenæum</i>,
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, and the <i>Parthenon</i>, and from Magazines,
the conjectures of their correspondents. When the real name of the
correspondent, or what might be such, was signed, we have given it in
our notes, as ‘Hickson,’ ‘S.&nbsp;Verges’ (from <i>Notes and
Queries</i>). When the name was obviously fictitious, or when the
article was not signed at all, we have noted it thus: ‘Anon. (N. and Q.)

Queries</i>, <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘Spedding,’ ‘Bullock,’ ‘Lloyd,’ ‘Williams,’ ‘Wright,’ indicate

In conclusion, we commend this volume, the first product of long labour,
to the indulgent judgement of critics. In saying this we are not merely
repeating a stereotyped phrase. We have found errors in the work of the
most accurate of our predecessors. We cannot hope to have attained
perfect accuracy ourselves, especially when we consider the wide range
which our collation has embraced, and the minute points which we have
endeavoured to record, but at all events we have spared no pains to
render our work as exact as we could. Those who have ever undertaken a
similar task will best understand the difficulty, and will be most ready
to make allowance for shortcomings. ‘Expertus disces quam gravis iste
labor.’</p>

<p>The five plays contained in this volume occur in the first Folio in
the same order, and, with one exception, were there printed for the
first time.</p>

<p>In the case of <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, two Quartos
(Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>), imperfect copies of an earlier play,
appeared in 1602 and 1619, the second a reprint of the first. They are
described in a special Introduction to that play, and a reprint of
Q<sub>1</sub>, collated with Q<sub>2</sub>, follows it. A&nbsp;third
Quarto (Q<sub>3</sub>) was printed from F<sub>1</sub> in 1630.</p>

<p><i>The Tempest</i> was altered by Dryden and D’Avenant, and published
as <i>The Tempest; or the Enchanted Island</i>, in 1669. We mark the
emendations derived from it: ‘Dryden’s version.’ D’Avenant, in his
<i>Law against Lovers</i> fused <i>Measure for Measure</i> and <i>Much
ado about Nothing</i> into one play. We refer to his new readings as
being from ‘D’Avenant’s version.’</p>

Age</i>, 1693, gave rise to a sharp controversy.</p>

<p><a name = "note8" id = "note8" href = "#tag8">8.</a>
Capell, who might be supposed to write ‘sine ira et studio,’ denies to
Theobald even this merit: ‘His work is only made a little better [than
Pope’s] by his having a few more materials; of which he was not a better
collator than the other, nor did he excel him in use of them.’ The
result of the collations we have made leads us to a very different
conclusion.</p>

<p><a name = "note9" id = "note9" href = "#tag9">9.</a>
Notwithstanding this claim of identity, Warburton seems to have used
Theobald’s text to print from. Capell positively affirms this, (Preface,
p.&nbsp;18).</p>

<p><a name = "note10" id = "note10" href = "#tag10">10.</a>
Dr Johnson told Burney that Warburton, as a critic, ‘would make
two-and-fifty Theobalds cut into slices.’ (Boswell’s <i>Life of
Johnson</i>, Vol. ii. p. 85. Ed. 1835). From this judgment, whether they
be compared as critics or editors, we emphatically dissent.</p>

<p><a name = "note11" id = "note11" href = "#tag11">11.</a>
We trust that in our edition the matter which Capell discarded has been
presented in a well-printed book. We have found no trace of the
Manuscripts here spoken&nbsp;of.</p>

<p><a name = "note12" id = "note12" href = "#tag12">12.</a>
In Lowndes’s <i>Manual</i> (Bohm), p. 2316, we find ‘Notes and Various
Readings to Shakespeare. By Edward Capell, Lond. 1759.’ No such book of
this date is in the Capell collection, nor is it ever mentioned
elsewhere, so far as we know. In the preface to the work of 1783, it is
mentioned that the first volume had been printed in 1774, but no
allusion is made to any former edition.</p>

<p><a name = "note13" id = "note13" href = "#tag13">13.</a>
These volumes, together with the whole of Shakespeare’s <i>Plays</i> and
Milton’s <i>Paradise Lost</i>, written out in Capell’s own regular, but
not very legible hand, are among his collection in Trinity College
Library.</p>

<p><a name = "note14" id = "note14" href = "#tag14">14.</a>
Steevens was accused of giving, under fictitious names, notes which he
was afraid to sign himself.</p>

<p><a name = "note15" id = "note15" href = "#tag15">15.</a>
The two last-named books, as well as some suggestions from
correspondents, did not reach us till the first Volume was partly
printed. We propose to supply all omissions in an Appendix to the whole
work.</p>

Aber man läuft ein gefährliches Spiel, wenn man nicht überall offen und
bescheiden bekennt, dass man ganz von den Engländern abhange: ja man
scheitert gewiss, wenn man mit der einen Hand allen Stoff von dem man
lebt und athmet ihnen entnimmt, und mit der andern zum Dank Hohn und
Beleidigung auf ihren Namen wirft. <i>Vorrede</i>, pp. vi.&nbsp;vii.</p>
